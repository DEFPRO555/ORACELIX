- Maximum file size: 200 MB

---

### Step 3: Review Your Data

**Section:** "📊 Data Upload & Overview"

**What to Check:**
1. **Total Records** - How many customers
2. **Features** - How many data columns
3. **Missing Values** - Data quality check
4. **Data Quality Score** - Should be >90%

**Data Preview:**
- See first 20 rows of your data
- Check columns loaded correctly
- Verify customer IDs present
- Review data types

**What Good Data Looks Like:**
```
Total Records:     8,950 customers ✅
Features:          18 columns ✅
Missing Values:    13 (<1%) ✅
Data Quality:      99.9% ✅
```

**If You See Problems:**
- Missing values >10% → Clean your data first
- Wrong data types → Check numeric columns
- Duplicate IDs → Remove duplicates
- Quality <90% → Review data source

---

### Step 4: Explore Your Data

**Section:** "🔍 Data Explorer"

**What You'll Find:**

**1. Correlation Matrix**
- Shows which features relate to each other
- Red = negative correlation
- Blue = positive correlation
- Helps you understand relationships

**Example Insights:**
- "Balance" and "Credit Limit" are highly correlated (0.8)
- "Cash Advance" and "Purchases" are negatively correlated (-0.3)
- "Tenure" and "Loyalty" are positively correlated (0.6)

**2. Feature Distributions**
- Histogram charts for each variable
- See if data is balanced or skewed
- Identify outliers visually
- Understand value ranges

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Bell curve = normal distribution (good!)
- ⚠️ Heavy skew = may need transformation
- 🔍 Multiple peaks = natural segments exist
- ⚡ Outliers = extreme values to investigate

**3. Insights You Gain:**
- Which customers spend most
- Who has highest balances
- Who uses cash advances
- Distribution of credit limits

**Time Investment:** 2-3 minutes browsing

---

### Step 5: Select Features

**Section:** "⚙️ Feature Engineering"

**What This Does:**
Chooses which customer characteristics to use for grouping

**Default Features (Recommended):**
```
✅ BALANCE          - Account balance
✅ PURCHASES        - Purchase amounts
✅ CASH_ADVANCE     - Cash advances
✅ CREDIT_LIMIT     - Credit limit
✅ PAYMENTS         - Payment amounts
✅ TENURE           - Customer tenure
```

**How to Choose:**
1. Use defaults if unsure (works 90% of time)
2. Select 5-8 features for best results
3. Choose features that vary between customers
4. Avoid highly correlated features

**What the System Does:**
1. **Before Scaling:**
   - Shows raw values
   - Different units and scales
   - Hard to compare

2. **After Scaling:**
   - Standardizes all features
   - Mean = 0, Standard deviation = 1
   - Fair comparison across features

**PCA Visualization:**
- 2D map of your customers
- Each dot = one customer
- Closeness = similarity
- Spreads = diversity in customer base

**Time Investment:** 1-2 minutes selection

---

### Step 6: Find Optimal Clusters

**Section:** "📈 Optimal Cluster Detection"

**What This Does:**
Determines the best number of customer segments (groups)

**Settings:**
```
Min Clusters:  2  (minimum groups)
Max Clusters:  6  (maximum groups)
```

**Recommended:**
- Start with 2-6 (fastest, usually sufficient)
- Expand to 2-10 if needed (takes ~10 seconds)
- Rarely need more than 8 segments

**Click:** "🔮 Detect Optimal Clusters"

**What Happens:**
```
🔮 Computing K=2... (1/5)
⏱️ Time remaining: 4.2s

🔮 Computing K=3... (2/5)
⏱️ Time remaining: 3.1s

🔮 Computing K=4... (3/5)
⏱️ Time remaining: 2.0s

✅ Completed in 6.3s!
```

**You'll See Two Charts:**

**1. Elbow Method Chart**
- Shows "inertia" (tightness of clusters)
- Look for the "elbow" - where line bends
- That's usually optimal K

**Example:**
```
  ^
  │     ●
I │       ●
n │         ●
e │           ●── Elbow at K=4
r │             ●●●●
t │
  └─────────────────►
    2  3  4  5  6  7  K
```

**2. Silhouette Score Chart**
- Measures cluster quality (0 to 1)
- Higher is better
- Look for the peak

**Example:**
```
  ^
S │           ●── Peak at K=4
c │         ●   ●
o │       ●       ●
r │     ●           ●
e │   ●
  └─────────────────►
    2  3  4  5  6  7  K
```

**ORACELIX Recommends:**
```
Optimal K (Silhouette):    4 clusters
Best Silhouette Score:     0.409 (Good!)
Recommendation:            Use K=4
```

**What the Numbers Mean:**
- **Silhouette 0.5-1.0** = Excellent separation
- **Silhouette 0.3-0.5** = Good separation ✅
- **Silhouette 0.2-0.3** = Weak separation
- **Silhouette <0.2** = Poor separation

**Time Investment:** 6-10 seconds processing, 1 minute review

---

### Step 7: Create Customer Segments

**Section:** "🎯 Segmentation"

**What Happens:**
- AI trains the final model

```
Clusters:           4 segments
Silhouette Score:   0.409 (Good!)
Davies-Bouldin:     1.234 (Lower is better)
```

**2. Segment Distribution**
- Pie chart showing segment sizes
- Each segment as percentage
- Number of customers per segment

**Example:**
```
Segment 0:  2,340 customers (26%)
Segment 1:  2,890 customers (32%)
Segment 2:  1,920 customers (22%)
Segment 3:  1,800 customers (20%)
```

**3. Visual Map (PCA)**
- See all customers on 2D map
- Each segment = different color
- Clusters clearly separated
- Outliers visible

**4. Segment Profiles**
- Average values per segment
- Compare segments side-by-side
- Understand what makes each unique

**Example Table:**
```
Segment | Balance | Purchases | Cash Adv | Limit  | Size
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
0       | $450    | $200      | $0       | $2,000 | 2,340
1       | $2,100  | $2,500    | $100     | $8,000 | 2,890
2       | $800    | $600      | $400     | $3,000 | 1,920
3       | $1,500  | $1,200    | $200     | $5,000 | 1,800
